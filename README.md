# Koko Theme

I created this repo so whenever I move to a new computer or change my theme setups for my terminal development, I can keep everything in sync. Having a good terminal setup with the right plugins gets increases your productivity flying and just feels good! Who ever said teminals should concern them selves with UI/UX?
